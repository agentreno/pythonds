# pythonds
Any code examples I write while I work through the excellent 'Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures' book: http://www.interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html

Mind map of the information in the book as I get through it:

## TODO

- Implement a Queue that has O(1) for queue/dequeue on average
  (use a built-in collections.deque where only appendleft/pop are used)
- Implement the remaining operations for OrderedList
  (skeleton functions in lists.py)
- Implement a doubly linked list
  (add back pointers to linked list in lists.py and update operations)
